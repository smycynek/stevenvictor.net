                    <p class="indented">
                        I've worked in the Boston area for most of my career. I often
                        lean towards software that focuses on engineering, math,
                        and geometry.  Recently, I changed focus
                        from Windows/desktop/static-typed
                        develpment to more Linux/web/scripting development.  I've always
                        been very API focused, but API used to be a specialized part of
                        system programming, like COM, but now, with REST, API development
                        is just plain "development", so I've become more of a generalist :)

                        I create a lot of toy projects that you can see on this site.
                        (Hopefully obviously), they
                        often don't accurately represent what I do in my day job
                        (see <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-mycynek/">
                            LinkedIn </a>for that)
                        -- they are more just to expand my skills and try new things.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indented">
                        Unfortunately, I don't tweet or blog much, and my Instagram
                        is private, so please contact me directly for more info.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Uh, okay, so seriously, who are you?</h1>
                    <p class="indented">
                        My dad (The 'Victor' in Steven Victor) designed television sets and
                        television broadcast systems
                        for Zenith Electronics for nearly forty years, so I'm obsessed
                        with pixels, aspect ratios, Dolby Vision, and
                        <a

                            "the soap opera effect."</a>
                        <p class="indented"> I collect,
                            shadow-box, frame, and hang antique tools, like compasses, soldering irons,
                            and pocket-knives. I do standup comedy on occasion. I lift weights.
                            I program home lighting systems but haven't bothered with a Nest
                            thermostat.  I'm lucky to have my wife and daughter. </p>

                            Some of my favorite books are <i>God's Debris</i>, by Scott Adams (yes,
                            he's gone crazy, but it's still a good book),
                            <i>A Random Walk down Wall Street</i>, by Burton Malkiel, and
                            <i>Fundamentals of Graphic Communication</i> by Bertoline et all.
                            If I could retire early, I think I'd do standup comedy and coach kids
                            on math and programming -- and watch too much Netflix.
